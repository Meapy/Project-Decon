dear
mr.
schools:
on
behalf
of
the
department
of
justice
gender
equality
network
(doj
"gen),"
we
thank
you
for
taking
the
time
to
meet
with
us
on
wednesday.
we
very
much
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
discuss
your
commitment
to
eradicating
sexual
harassment
and
misconduct
at
the
department
and
our
suggestions
for
ways
to
enforce
the
department’s
“zero
tolerance”
policy.
as
you
"know,"
the
office
of
the
inspector
general
(oig)
identified
systemic
issues
with
the
department’s
handling
of
sexual
harassment
and
misconduct
complaints.!
to
summarize
what
we
"discussed,"
we
urge
the
department
to
enact
the
following
reforms
in
accordance
with
the
oig’s
recommendations
and
observations:
e
establish
a
table
of
penalties
consisting
of
recommended
(but
not
mandatory)
disciplinary
actions
for
sexual
harassment
and
misconduct
to
help
standardize
responses
across
the
department.?
as
a
recent
congressional
report
issued
by
the
house
committee
on
oversight
and
government
reform
"revealed,’"
the
justice
department
is
one
of
the
few
federal
agencies
that
lacks
an
agency-
wide
table
of
penalties.
we
believe
that
this
contributed
to
the
civil

the
handling
of
sexual
misconduct

a
table

penalties
should
be
used
in
conjunction
with
the

"factors,"
not
in
lieu
of
them.

(1981).
whereas
the
douglas
factors
delineate
criteria
that
offices
must
consider
when
punishing
any
misconduct
(such
as
the
employee’s
job
evel
or
disciplinary
"history),"
a
table
of
penalties
lists
specific
offenses
and
suggests
disciplinary
actions
for
"each,"
ranging
from
reprimand
to
removal.
