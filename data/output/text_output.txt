We are current and former public officials and employees of the New York State government.
Like many of the brave women and men wha have come forward in recent months, we have suffered
degrading acts of sexual harassment in the workplace or we know someone who has,

Sesual harassment in Uwe workplace interferes wilt our right to work, An umnvanted touch, a
rope, a joke about our bodies, or a comment with a sexually suggestive undertone undermines our
positions as equal participants in the workplace. For too fong the victims of sexual harassment,
portisularly weamen, have worried Ghat no cae would believe them, that jobs could be lost and careers
<eraile, impairing the ability to care for thet families

We are at a watershed moment in our history. As more of us come forward, i is move difficult
for us 10 be ignored or disbelicved. We stand together to change the eulture that demeans and belies
hose who find themselves in these situations and 10 say loudly, no more

Perpetratars of sexual harassment need (o lose their sense of enttlemiem! and be held accoustable

 

for theit actions. Those who witness harmful acts but tum 2 blind eye must understand that ther silence
diministes our efforts to establish & gonder-cqual workplace whether in goverment, media, academia,
fenteniainment or the corporate arena, We want victims who have remained silent to Feel confident that
eit speaking up will be respected and addressed, and we want those who wiltess such behavior 42
speak out

While we embrace this moment of uth, we must, as leaders and role models, acknowledge that
‘we have a responsibility o show the next generation thal men and Women can ad should work with
each other to establish and maintain respectful relationships inthe workplace.

‘Atthis time, we ask the State of New York to convene a task force to examine the pervasiveness
OF the problem of sexual harassment throughout the state in both the public and private seciors and 1
evaluate the effectiveness of current palicies and faws, We welcome the Governor's recent
announcement supporting a number of proposals and look forward ta working with him

‘Que ses as jus begun,

Sincerely,
