Dear Mr. Schools:

On behalf of the Department of Justice Gender Equality Network (DOJ GEN), we
thank you for taking the time to meet with us on Wednesday. We very much appreciate
the opportunity to discuss your commitment to eradicating sexual harassment and
misconduct at the Department and our suggestions for ways to enforce the Department’s
“zero tolerance” policy.

As you know, the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) identified systemic issues
with the Department’s handling of sexual harassment and misconduct complaints.! To
summarize what we discussed, we urge the Department to enact the following reforms in
accordance with the OIG’s recommendations and observations:

e Establish a table of penalties consisting of recommended (but not mandatory)
disciplinary actions for sexual harassment and misconduct to help standardize
responses across the Department.? As a recent congressional report issued by
the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform revealed,’ the
Justice Department is one of the few federal agencies that lacks an agency-
wide table of penalties. We believe that this contributed to the Civil

2 A table of penalties should be used in conjunction with the Douglas factors, not in lieu of them. See

Douglas v. Veterans Administration, 5 M.S.R.P. 280, 305-06 (1981). Whereas the Douglas factors
delineate criteria that offices must consider when punishing any misconduct (such as the employee’s job
evel or disciplinary history), a table of penalties lists specific offenses and suggests disciplinary actions for
each, ranging from reprimand to removal.
